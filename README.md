# PCA-Based-Digit-Classification-Big-Data-Analysis-
MNIST Digit Classification using PCA and Gaussian Naive Bayes
A Python implementation of handwritten digit classification using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and Gaussian Naive Bayes for classification on the MNIST dataset.
**Overview**

This project demonstrates how dimensionality reduction can be effectively used for digit classification. The implementation uses PCA to reduce the 784-dimensional MNIST images to a lower-dimensional space and then applies Gaussian Naive Bayes classification based on multivariate normal distributions.

**Features**

Dimensionality Reduction: Uses PCA to reduce MNIST images from 784 to a configurable number of principal components

Gaussian Classification: Implements classification using multivariate normal distributions for each digit class

Hyperparameter Optimization: Automatically finds the optimal number of principal components

Visualization: Includes scatter plots of the first two principal components and accuracy curves

High Performance: Achieves ~96% accuracy with optimal component selection

**Requirements**

bashpip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn scipy

**Dataset**
The project uses the MNIST dataset from OpenML, which contains:

70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9)

Each image is 28Ã—28 pixels (784 features)

Training set: 56,000 images (80%)

Test set: 14,000 images (20%)

**Implementation Details**
Algorithm Steps

Data Preprocessing: Normalize pixel values to [0, 1] range

Train-Test Split: Split data into 80% training and 20% testing

PCA Transformation: Apply PCA to reduce dimensionality

Parameter Estimation: Calculate mean and covariance matrix for each digit class

Classification: Use maximum likelihood estimation with multivariate normal distributions

Evaluation: Calculate accuracy and visualize results

**Usage**

Open and run the Jupyter notebook:

bashjupyter notebook mnist_pca_classification.ipynb
